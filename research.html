            <h3>Project Context</h3>
            <p>As part of my Research for Design class, I had to conduct an ethnographic research ona group of people of my choice. I decided that I wanted to  understand better people that transgress societal expectations, roles and norms. We can make a difference through design, albeit little is done for such transgressive people. I took this project as a first chance to step into designing having a minority in mind, Trans people in the Netherlands.</p>

            <h3>Interview and Observation</h3>
            <p>In order to truly immerse myself into the project and understand what Trans people can go through, I interviewed and observed some people that identify themselves as Trans, throughout a period of 3 months. I participated to a Gay Pride, talked to students, contacted online groups and Trans activists in order to look for people willing to share their stories. This is how I met a very committed activist from the Trans community. Through her, I managed to participaye into cozy and intimate events targeted to Trans and allies only, where I was welcomed and trusted. This experience proved to be a rather informal and human-centered approach to gather data. </p>

            <h3>Insights</h3>
            <p>Given the intimate set-up and trust people I interviewed granted me, I gathered very valuable information. I started off by clustering my findings into meaningful groups of data.</p>

            <p>After triangulating my findings with current literature review on the topic and desk research, I analyzed and synthetized the information into meaningful insights. The image below is an overview of the project.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Trans people experience a 2-layer discrimination: linked to being Trans and to their new gender identity</li>
              <li>Transgender people feel that they should not be defined by the fact that they are transitioning from one gender to the other. They are not their transition</li>
              <li>Trans people feel pressure to fit the socialized gender norms at some point in their transitioning</li>
