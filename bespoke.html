            <h3>Project Context</h3>
            <p>Hallmark.nl is the Dutch subsidiary of Hallmarks Cards, whose aim is to <q>inspire people to express their emotions and strengthen valuable relationships</q>. As part of my UX Design studies, we were presented with the challenge to redesign the intangible gift giving experience for Hallmark.nl. The core of the project was aimed at creating a bespoke solution for people living far away, using the Design Thinking Process.</p>

            <h3>User Research</h3>
            <p>Understanding the people involved with the experience is the first step in a human-centered approach. My design partner and I started our design journey by selecting a series of research techniques appropriate to empathize and prone to unveil people's needs and motivations around gift giving and receiving experiences. <a class="style-link" href="https://www.ideo.com/post/method-cards" target="_blank">IDEO's Method Cards</a> were used as an inspirational tool.</p>
            <p>With the insights gathered from the research process, we individually drafted a user persona and a design vision around the three components of the intangible gift giving experience: the card personalization tool, the resulting card and the digital unwrapping of the intangible gift. We ultimately defined our final design vision and crafted our persona.</p>

            <h3>Ideation</h3>
            <p>Having our challenge defined, we moved towards the ideation phase of the design process. I started by drafitng a list of How Might We questions around the different components of the design vision. Those questions, in conjunction with different diverging techniques, helped me come up a diverse and creative series of sketches. Having a broad array of ideas, my partner and I started converging individually, created storyboards with our top three concepts and dot-voted for the most suitable one, as shown below.</p>

              <img class="case-study-image-height" src="images/dotvote.png" alt="Dot voting of main concepts">
            </div>
            <p>At this point, we decided to adopt the most voted idea as the main concept and use underlying ideas of other storyboards to spice our the final design concept. Memories were at the core of our project and different senses should be used throughout the experience. Our concept focused, more precisely, on past memories lived by our persona during familty trips, while creating new memories by integrating multiple senses into our solution. Thus, our focus was geared towards wrapping our persona's gift with memories.</p>

            <h3>Prototyping and Testing</h3>
            <p>Being in charge of the digital unwrapping, I started by creating a low-fi paper prototype of this part of the experience. This allowed me to swiftly test, iterate and validate (or not!) initial ideas. My final paper prototype can be found below. </p>

            </div>
            <p>Before diving into the digital prototype of the digital unwrapping and, in order to have a cohesiveand coherent experience, my design partner and I started by analizing Hallmark.nl's visual elemente and brand identity. From that point on, I started designing the interface of the digital unwrapping, leveraging Hallmark.nl's current products and services, for instance, their existing mobile App. This would allow me to design a solution whose implementability would be quick, smooth and straightforward.</p>
            <p>Simultaneously, my design partner focused on prototyping the card personalization tool and together we created a physical prototype of the resulting card.</p>

            <h3>Solution</h3>
            <p>Our proposed solution was a coherent experience leveraging past memories all the while it would allow the creation of new ones. The final prototypes can be found below</p>
            <ul>

            <p>The card's paper prototype can be found below. It is a customized travel map the places our persona travelled to with family. It includes two layers: a transaparent one that is disposable and contains the instructions of the digital unwrapping experience that awaits and the map itself.</p>
