          <h3>Project Context</h3>
          <p>Hallmark.nl is the Dutch subsidiary of Hallmarks Cards, whose aim is to <q>inspire people to express their emotions and strengthen valuable relationships</q>. As part of my UX Design studies, we were presented with the challenge to redesign the intangible gift giving experience for Hallmark.nl. The core of the project was aimed at creating a bespoke solution for people living far away, using the Design Thinking Process.</p>

          <h3>User Research</h3>
          <p>Understanding the people involved with the experience is the first step in a human-centered approach. My design partner and I started our design journey by selecting a series of research techniques appropriate to empathize and prone to unveil people's needs and motivations around gift giving and receiving experiences. <a class="style-link" href="https://www.ideo.com/post/method-cards">IDEO's Method Cards</a> were used as an inspirational tool.</p>
          <p>With the insights gathered from the research process, we individually drafted a user persona and a design vision around the three components of the intangible gift giving experience: the card personalization tool, the resulting card and the digital unwrapping of the intangible gift. We ultimately defined our final design vision and crafted our persona.</p>

          <h3>Ideation</h3>
          <p>Having our challenge defined, we moved towards the ideation phase of the design process. I started by drafitng a list of How Might We questions around the different components of the design vision. Those questions, in conjunction with different diverging techniques, helped me come up a diverse and creative series of sketches. Having a broad array of ideas, my partner and I started converging individually, created storyboards with our top three concepts and dot-voted for the most suitable one.</p>
          <div class="case-study-image-position">
            <img class="case-study-image" src="images/dotvote.png" alt="Dot voting of main concepts">
          </div>
          <p>At this point, we decided to adopt the most voted idea as the main concept and use underlying ideas of other storyboards to spice our the final design concept. Memories were at the core of our project and different senses should be used throughout the experience. Our concept focused, more precisely, on memories created while travelling, thus the Travel Map was the starting point of our prototyping phase.</p>
